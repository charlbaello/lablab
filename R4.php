</br>Reflection Paper IV</br>
</br>Our 1st quiz, which is the User Interface, caused me a lot of fun since our section doesn’t have any idea on what kind of quiz will we have. </br>From the beginning you must click the word “here” just to be able to play the game and it is not that obvious to see if you are on a rush.</br> So, when I figured out how can I enter the game, suddenly our section became wild since we don’t have any idea on how this quiz works. </br>After that, things just get worse, starting from the “I do not accept the Terms and Conditions”, since I am used to clicking that whenever I register an account.</br> And when I clicked the Terms and Conditions, it is not scrollable and can only be done by pressing down repeatedly.</br> The part of choosing the password, tested my patience because I cannot go through no matter how I followed the guidelines at the bottom page, and after the lot of struggling our section have an idea now on how this quiz works It’s just having a very misleading UI can cause confusion to its users.</br> And with that we all get to know how this UI works so we try for the 2nd time and all of us got at least 2mins below.
