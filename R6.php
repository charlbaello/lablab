<p>
</br> The whole midterms have a lot of fun in the subject USERDES we already know how to design create our own webpage It was a lot of fun since the subject is not boring it’s because we are thinking creatively, I am happy because my grades are high in this subject I get 3.0, the whole midterms discussed about the About yourself since it’s the beginning of the class, second is about your favorite application so in there I choose 3 application which is: Messenger, Waze, Mobile Legends, and for the third lesson is How would you design an interface for a 1000 floor elevator, so this lesson makes us how creative we think on designing such a big 1000 floor building, and for the fourth week is the groupings that we know that we have to think as a group and create a Need finding, and for the fifth activity is our initial prototype-Login page so we discussed our idea about the petagram and we tell the ideas that we created and lastly the summarized of our website we design our own webpage containing our Lessons and activity and even reflection and after that we celebrate our SOCIT Fest and it was a lot of fun.
My Expectations for the finals in USERDES is to be the same happy subject helping each other back and working together as a team.
