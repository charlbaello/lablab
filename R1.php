</br> </br> First Week of USERDES Class</br> </br> 
During the first meeting of USERDES I was a bit nervous about this subject because I donâ€™t have any idea about It, however I was able to feel less nervous because, Ms. Jen was a very kind professor. </br> Well at first we made an Introduction about ourselves, Well at least this subject makes me to be a better writer in terms of essay and paper works, since I do have a lot of grammatical error and some incorrect spellings, this subject teaches a lot how technology works and even designing on a certain web. This subject will really help us as a whole. I know that 1st week meeting had a lot of introductions. </br> So, the first one would be the Introduction about ourselves, well this made me think about the attributes and character that I possess and ponder how I would look like to others.</br>  The second one would be the Favorite application I honestly had a hard time on choosing what application, because there are various applications which I use a lot and It made me think of the most efficient and productive application that I use in my daily basis, so I came up with Messenger, Mobile Legends, and Waze.</br>  That was the application that I choose, and, we have a short presentation on what application we choose. I very like this subject It is very balance there is a time that we can have fun and there is a time that we need to focus. And Lastly we discuss about the Solutions and also about what will be your idea when designing a 1000 floor elevator, this topic make me think if this problem can give solutions and your own idea and design maybe in the next future I can implement those kinds of idea. </br>
