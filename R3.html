      </br>Reflection Paper 3</br>
 </br>Creating my own web application is quite fun activity since we get to experience how to create and design our own webpage by using html and CSS,</br> it’s kind a fun to me specially when I create my webpage and the design or idea that I like to put in my webpage is possible happening. After designing my own webpage the hard part for me is the 2 websites which is the Heroku and the GitHub sites, since I’m not yet familiar with this website, there is also difficulty in typing some codes since there has been a lot of things that needed to improve, especially for the designs.</br> As I try to learn how to navigate through Heroku, it took me a lot of time and still hasn’t progressed in uploading my work, </br>but the best thing is my classmates help me so that I can comply the requirements that needed in the USERDES subject.
