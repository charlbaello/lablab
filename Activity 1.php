			<p></br>I’am Good, always excited</br>
</br>I‘am from Taguig City</br>

</br>I am a jolly person always wanted to laugh, I’m a risk taker person, my daily hobbies are.</br> Playing Basketball, Guitar and I like to travel a lot. </br>Sometimes I travel by my self-going to Baguio since It is my birthplace.</br> I really like unexpected adventures, it’s because unexpected always happens, rather than preparing until it become a drawing...</br>

</br>I kind a struggle at first but every time I learned different knowledge I'm starting to like and like the course from time to time. </br>Well I enjoyed my summer a lot because I have freedom and I travel by myself too, and also, I have more time with my family, do the things that I haven't do when class still up, eventually I enjoyed my summer vacation.
</br></br>
My expectation In this class is to have fun while learning, balance, learn new things in this subject like design and specially programming. Since I don’t have any idea In this subject yet.
