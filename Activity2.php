			<p></br>Nowadays, almost everything works digitally and tend to drive people from making themselves engaged in social media and often connected to the internet, and with that I have this favorite application which I believe almost millions of people are also using day by day to stay connected and in touch with their family, friends, and more. This application is Messenger, what makes this application good is that it nearly has all of the capacity to contact someone from one country to another, it has a lot of great features, from chatting with someone, to call anyone from your contacts , and even have a video call with them, these are just 3 of the best features of the Messenger application, and I really like this application It is because of its free data and It really helps a lot when you don’t have any data usage to use. Imagine being able to connect with people from around the globe by just the use of this application, it is very efficient compared to the medium of communication back in the days. Of course, I use this application for messaging my family and friends to be able to stay in touch with them and updated from them. I cannot really state the exact period of time I use messenger but I can say that I use it way too often, but I always make sure to manage the usage of this application especially when in class, I try to avoid getting tempted to check and open my Messenger because it will distract me from listening in class.</br> With the help of this application even though we’re not together but the application itself make us connected each other.</br>

</br>Nowadays, almost everything works digitally and tend to drive people from making themselves engaged in searching for the best rout to outsmart traffic, for me this application helps a when it comes to outsmarting traffic, this application has the best 3 features for me, that it has maps that will determine where your location is and where is your final destination is, and the next one is it also has the features that it will also help you to find parking slot, if your destination doesn’t have parking slot it helps the user to find the nearest parking slot, and the last is the automatic voice message, that helps the user also to navigate the ways, the automated voice tells the user where to go, like “ In 100 meters Turn Right” for me I often use this application if I travel, If ever you don’t know the place, you can use this application.
