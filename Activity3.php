			<p></br>How would you design an interface for a 1000 floor elevator?</br></br>

</br>First of, my Idea on designing a 1000 floor elevator, is to have a digital press button in which the person who is riding the elevator will simply input their floor number and the elevator will basically bring the user to his desired floor. </br> By solving these issues, we can now proceed to the next concern regarding on designing and interface for a 1000 floor elevator.</br>
                                     
</br></br>Secondly, we must consider the height of the building, It is because it depends on what materials we will use, how long the material can reach and of course the expenses that will be produce, just to design a 1000 floor elevator. </br>
</br>2nd Is what kind of building It Is, If the type of building is a Hotel, condominium, or a company building, It is because the number of people who is going to ride the elevator, will be needing equipment’s. that can cover the entire population of a building which would probably have a thousands of employee.</br>
 3rd is What kind of requirements do we have on the size and speed of the elevator? Let’s assume the speed to be around 22 mph. based on my research (the Burj Khalifa’s top speed). This means it’d take around 8 and half minutes to get to the 1000th floor when travelling at top speed. </br>
</br>And lastly by the help of this digital press button no user will be hassle from transferring one elevator to another.
